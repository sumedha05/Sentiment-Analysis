# Sentiment-Analysis
Preprocessing of Tweets for Sentiment Analysis.
We will be doing sentiment analysis on tweets. To help with that, we will be using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package, an open-source Python library for natural language processing. It has modules for collecting, handling, and processing Twitter data. For this exercise, we will use a Twitter dataset that comes with NLTK. This dataset has been manually annotated and serves to establish baselines for models quickly.
